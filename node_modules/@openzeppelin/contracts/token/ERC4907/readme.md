# ERC-4907 Reference Implementation

- Standard document: [EIP-4907: Rental NFT, ERC-721 User And Expires
  Extension](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4907).
- Compatible with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)

## Why use this implementation?

- The included reference implementation over at ethereum/EIPs is full of
  trailing white space and inconsistent formatting. This one isn't.
- Original reference implementation isn't compatible to be neatly imported
  through foundry: This repository is compabible.

## License

As it's really just a neatly formatted and repackaged version of the original
reference implementation, we're using the same license:
